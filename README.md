👋 Hi, I’m @LaibaIstkar, a Flutter Application Developer and a Native Android Developer, as well as a student of the deen Islam. I am deeply passionate about using my development skills to create mobile applications that serve meaningful purposes, especially in the context of my faith, Islam. My goal is to build apps that offer valuable resources and support for the Islamic community, making spiritual and educational tools accessible and engaging.

👀 I’m focused on leveraging Flutter and native Android development to build cross-platform applications that provide intuitive and seamless user experiences. My journey has led me to explore various technologies and methodologies, but my heart is set on using these skills to contribute positively to my deen.

🌱 Currently, I’m working on an exciting upcoming project that integrates several features, including:

Quranic texts and Sunnah resources
Books of the Salaf
Interactive quizzes for users
Likely AI integration to enhance user experience and personalization

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me and align with my mission to support and uplift the Islamic community through technology. If you share a passion for combining tech with faith, let’s connect and work together on impactful projects!
